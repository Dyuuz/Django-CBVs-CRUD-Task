# Django-CBVs-CRUD-Task

Django Car Management System with Django, Python, HTMX, Bootstrap & Vue

This project is a dynamic Django-based web application for managing car data. It implements full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using Django's generic class-based views, HTMX for interactivity without full-page reloads, and Bootstrap for styling. Vue is optionally included for component-based enhancements.
